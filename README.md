# Employee Life Experience and Job Satisfaction Insights  

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes employee survey data to uncover patterns in life experience and job satisfaction. The goal is to understand how factors such as **workload**, **overtime**, **commuting**, and **departmental roles** influence employee well-being. Insights from this analysis help identify areas where organizations can improve work-life balance and reduce stress across teams.  

## Objectives  
Assess overall **job satisfaction** and **work-life balance** levels  
Identify how **overtime, commuting, and departmental workloads** impact employees  
Compare **workload and stress levels** across departments  
Provide actionable recommendations to improve employee experience  

## Tools & Methods  

### Data Cleaning  
**Python**: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and corrected inconsistencies in categorical fields  
Exported the cleaned dataset for visualization  

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
Calculated averages and distributions for key metrics: **job satisfaction, work-life balance, sleep hours, and workload**  
Compared satisfaction across **job levels, genders, and departments**  

### Visualization  
**Power BI** was used to create an interactive dashboard  
Key visuals included:  
**Doughnut charts** (commute modes, gender, overtime)  
**Bar charts** (employee distribution by department)  
**Column charts** (job satisfaction vs. work environment, experience vs. job level)  
**Workload by Dept chart** (workload and stress across departments)  

## Key Findings  
Average **job satisfaction: 3.39**  
Average **work-life balance: 3.06**  
**69% of employees do not work overtime**, suggesting most maintain regular schedules  
Commute modes are dominated by **Car (35%)** and **Public Transport (29.6%)**  
**Senior employees** are the largest group (3,644 of 10,245) but do not report consistently higher satisfaction  
**Marketing and Legal departments carry the heaviest workloads**  
**Stress levels** are fairly even, with **Legal and Finance slightly higher** than others  

## Conclusion  
The analysis highlights **moderate satisfaction levels** across the organization, with workload and departmental differences as key pressure points. Most employees avoid overtime, but commuting and heavy workloads in specific departments reduce overall balance.  

## Recommendations  
1. **Rebalance Workload in Marketing and Legal**  
   Redistribute tasks, automate repetitive work, or increase staffing support to reduce employee strain  
2. **Provide Stress Support in Finance and Legal**  
   Offer wellness resources, stress management training, and counseling to reduce long-term burnout risks  
3. **Expand Work-Life Balance Programs**  
   Encourage flexible schedules, hybrid work options, and other balance-focused initiatives to improve employee well-being across the board
